The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale | [] | All creatures have "At the beginning of your upkeep, destroy this creature unless you pay {1}."
Thran Portal | ['Gate'] | This land enters tapped unless you control two or fewer other lands. As this land enters, choose a basic land type. This land is the chosen type in addition to its other types. Mana abilities of this land cost an additional 1 life to activate.
Unholy Citadel | [] | Black legendary creatures you control have "bands with other legendary creatures." (Any legendary creatures can attack in a band as long as at least one has "bands with other legendary creatures." Bands are blocked as a group. If at least two legendary creatures you control, one of which has "bands with other legendary creatures," are blocking or being blocked by the same creature, you divide that creature's combat damage, not its controller, among any of the creatures it's being blocked by or is blocking.)
