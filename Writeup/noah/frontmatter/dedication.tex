\chapter*{Dedication and acknowledgements}
\begin{SingleSpace}
I am hugely grateful for the expert advice of my supervisor John Lapinskas and for the support of my partner Rosie Solomon, and for my parents, Elizabeth and Peter Liddle, who provided support and advice on statistical analysis. Thanks also to my tutor, Sarah Connolly, for helping me to keep a level head. And, of course, I owe a deep thank you to my Magic: The Gathering community, particularly to Ben Hammond, who pointed me to some useful algorithms, and to Ollie Gibb, who first taught me to play.
