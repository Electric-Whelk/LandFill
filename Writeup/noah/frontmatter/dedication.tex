\chapter*{Dedication and acknowledgements}

LandFill could not have been developed without the expert advice of my supervisor John Lapinskas or the support of my partner Rosie Solomon, nor my parents, Elizabeth and Peter Liddle, who provided support and advice on statistical research. Thanks also to my tutor, Sarah Connolly, for helping me to keep a clear head. And, of course, I owe a deep thank you to my Magic: The Gathering community, particularly Ben Hammond, who pointed me to some useful algorithms, and Ollie Gibb, who first taught me to play.
